# Usage

IMPORTANT: This ALPHA release has NOT been tested on many Moodle sites. Although we expect everything to work, if you find a problem, please help by reporting it in the [Bug Tracker](https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-local_aiid/issues).

# Updating

There are no special considerations required for updating the plugin.

The first public ALPHA version has not yet been released.

For more information on releases since then, see
[CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-local_aiid/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

# Uninstallation

Uninstalling the plugin by going into the following:

Home > Administration > Site Administration > Plugins > Manage plugins > AI Course Designer

...and click Uninstall. You may also need to manually delete the following folder if your webserver does not have the required permissions:

    /local/aiid

# Limitations

The plugin is currently incomplete.

The plugin can only create courses in languages for which language packs are installed on the site and that which GPT supports. This plugin has not been tested for right-to-left (RTL) language support. If you want to use this plugin with an RTL language and it doesn't work as-is, feel free to prepare a pull request and submit it to the project page at:

https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-local_aiid

# Language Support

This plugin includes support for the English language.

If you need a different language that is not yet supported, please feel free to contribute using the Moodle AMOS Translation Toolkit for Moodle at

https://lang.moodle.org/

Customizing or translating Generative prompts

You can translate or customize existing generative AI prompts in Moodle's language editor. Here is how to do it:

1. Navigate to Site Administration > Language > Language Customization.
2. Select the language you want to customize.
3. Click the **Open Language Pack for Editing** button.
4. Wait until the **Continue** button appears. This may take a little time. Please be patient.
5. In the **Show Strings of These Components** field, scroll down and select **local_aiid.php**.
6. Click the **Show Strings** button.
7. Scroll down to the strings that begin with **prompt_**.
8. Edit the prompts as needed.
9. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the **Save changes to the language pack** button.

For more information on editing language strings in Moodle, visit https://docs.moodle.org/en/Language_customisation.

# FAQ

IMPORTANT: Although we expect everything to work, this release has not been fully tested in every situation. If you find a problem, please help by reporting it in the [Bug Tracker](https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-local_aiid/issues).

**Does AIID log course generation requests?**

Not yet. However it will in the future for security audit reasons.

**Are there any security considerations?**

Security has not yet been implemented. Currently, only site administrators can use the tool.

**How can I get answers to other questions?**

Got a burning question that is not covered here? If you can't find your answer, submit your question in the Moodle forums or open a new issue on Github at:
